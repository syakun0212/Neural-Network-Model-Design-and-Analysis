# Neural-Network-Model-Design-and-Analysis

This Project aims to Design and Analyse a Neural Network model using injection molding dataset. 

It consists of 4 parts:

#### 1. Model Design
- Design a three-layer feed-forward neural network to solve the monitoring problem of 
injection molding machine
- Evaluation metric: classification error 

#### 2. Study the effect of network structure (hidden nodes, hidden layers) on classification performance 
- Shallow network vs Deep network 

#### 3. Study the effect of learning rate on classification performance 
- Adaptive vs Non-adaptive model 

#### 4. Study the effect of mini-batch size on model performance
